/// A [ScrollView] that creates custom scroll effects using slivers.

///
/// A [InfiniteScrollView] lets you supply [slivers] directly to create various
/// scrolling effects, such as lists, grids, and expanding headers. For example,
/// to create a scroll view that contains an expanding app bar followed by a
/// list and a grid, use a list of three slivers: [SliverAppBar], [SliverList],
/// and [SliverGrid].
///
/// [Widget]s in these [slivers] must produce [RenderSliver] objects.
///
/// To control the initial scroll offset of the scroll view, provide a
/// [controller] with its [ScrollController.initialScrollOffset] property set.

/// This sample code shows a scroll view that contains a flexible pinned app
/// bar, a grid, and an infinite list.
///
/// ```dart
/// InfiniteScrollView(
///   slivers: <Widget>[
///     const SliverAppBar(
///       pinned: true,
///       expandedHeight: 250.0,
///       flexibleSpace: FlexibleSpaceBar(
///         title: Text('Demo'),
///       ),
///     ),
///     SliverGrid(
///       gridDelegate: const SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent(
///         maxCrossAxisExtent: 200.0,
///         mainAxisSpacing: 10.0,
///         crossAxisSpacing: 10.0,
///         childAspectRatio: 4.0,
///       ),
///       delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
///         (BuildContext context, int index) {
///           return Container(
///             alignment: Alignment.center,
///             color: Colors.teal[100 * (index % 9)],
///             child: Text('Grid Item $index'),
///           );
///         },
///         childCount: 20,
///       ),
///     ),
///     SliverFixedExtentList(
///       itemExtent: 50.0,
///       delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
///         (BuildContext context, int index) {
///           return Container(
///             alignment: Alignment.center,

/// By default, if items are inserted at the "top" of a scrolling container like
/// [ListView] or [InfiniteScrollView], the top item and all of the items below it
/// are scrolled downwards. In some applications, it's preferable to have the
/// top of the list just grow upwards, without changing the scroll position.
/// This example demonstrates how to do that with a [InfiniteScrollView] with
/// two [SliverList] children, and the [InfiniteScrollView.center] set to the key
/// of the bottom SliverList. The top one SliverList will grow upwards, and the
/// bottom SliverList will grow downwards.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/scroll_view/custom_scroll_view.1.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## Accessibility
///
/// A [InfiniteScrollView] can allow Talkback/VoiceOver to make announcements
/// to the user when the scroll state changes. For example, on Android an
/// announcement might be read as "showing items 1 to 10 of 23". To produce
/// this announcement, the scroll view needs three pieces of information:
///
///   * The first visible child index.
///   * The total number of children.
///   * The total number of visible children.
///
/// The last value can be computed exactly by the framework, however the first
/// two must be provided. Most of the higher-level scrollable widgets provide
/// this information automatically. For example, [ListView] provides each child
/// widget with a semantic index automatically and sets the semantic child
/// count to the length of the list.
///
/// To determine visible indexes, the scroll view needs a way to associate the
/// generated semantics of each scrollable item with a semantic index. This can
/// be done by wrapping the child widgets in an [IndexedSemantics].
///
/// This semantic index is not necessarily the same as the index of the widget in
/// the scrollable, because some widgets may not contribute semantic
/// information. Consider a [ListView.separated]: every other widget is a
/// divider with no semantic information. In this case, only odd numbered
/// widgets have a semantic index (equal to the index ~/ 2). Furthermore, the
/// total number of children in this example would be half the number of
/// widgets. (The [ListView.separated] constructor handles this
/// automatically; this is only used here as an example.)
///
/// The total number of visible children can be provided by the constructor
/// parameter `semanticChildCount`. This should always be the same as the
/// number of widgets wrapped in [IndexedSemantics].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [SliverList], which is a sliver that displays linear list of children.
///  * [SliverFixedExtentList], which is a more efficient sliver that displays
///    linear list of children that have the same extent along the scroll axis.
///  * [SliverGrid], which is a sliver that displays a 2D array of children.
///  * [SliverPadding], which is a sliver that adds blank space around another
///    sliver.
///  * [SliverAppBar], which is a sliver that displays a header that can expand
///    and float as the scroll view scrolls.
///  * [ScrollNotification] and [NotificationListener], which can be used to watch
///    the scroll position without using a [ScrollController].
///  * [IndexedSemantics], which allows annotating child lists with an index
///    for scroll announcements.
